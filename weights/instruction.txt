Hi,
In this directory you paste the weights u download from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

Having done this,
execute convert weights.py

After this, in the video.py, edit and change the path of weights that is, weightfile='/weights/yolov3_weights.tf'
Then run the video.py to see yourself being detected along with other objects!
